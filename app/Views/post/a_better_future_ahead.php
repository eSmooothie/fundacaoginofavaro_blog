                      /Australian immigrant from Darwin, Australia who started to live in Timor-Leste (then Portuguese Timor) in the year 1970. Mr. Gino Favaro has witnessed the struggles of Timor-Leste up to and beyond the independence of the Nation. Mr. Gino Favaro accepted the Very Rare Opportunity with Immense Honor of donating to the people of Timor-Leste a special gift, The very first Constitutional National Ceremonial flag of the tiny Nation. Thus, has enhanced the reputation of his name in the Nation of Timor-Leste.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Now, let us chat about the Foundation and its essence to the people of Timor-Leste.
                      The Foundation has three main objectives: <br><span class="fst-italic">(The Following are from the words of Mr. Gino Favaro)</span></p>

                            <p class="mb-0" style="text-align:justify;">The Fundação Gino Favaro first objective is to promote and develop and engage in the tourism and hospitality industry, including religious tourism, cultural tourism, historical tourism, and other special tourism aspects.
                              To engage in the Hospitality & Tourism Industry in providing Quality Hotels and International Standard Tourism Facilities all around Timor-Leste.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">There are very few hotels around the country side and not many that are categorized as Premium Hotels accept in
                      the Capital of Dili. If the Timor-Leste Government allows it to develop the country in accordance with the Timor-Leste National Tourism Policy “GROWING TOURISM TO 2030, Enhancing a National Identity this world be a majot benefit for the Fundação Gino Favaro.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The Fundação wants to build and operate fully functional Quality Hotels with Shopping Facilities
                      throughout the country. To develop and manage to International Standards, Tourism locations across the
                      country as many of these locations have no roads or facilities at these spots, travelers have mentioned that they would like to
                      explore these special locations but when they have to walk between 3 to 4 km by foot after parking the car to get to this location their desire dwindles a bit.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">This is where the Fundação wishes to seek donor funding to develop these special locations so that they are made available for all to see and explore and use. These hotels with shopping centers and international standard, tourism facilities will be available to local and international travelers’ and will be specially built as practical training facilities for Timorese Students, so as to enhance the professional level of students wanting to enter the industry. It is intended that these student training facilities will have suitable student accommodation, other student facilities, food canteens, so that the students can Learn, Work and Rest in the knowledge that they are being respected as potentially important people of the industry. It is the intentions of the Fundação Gino Favaro to fully co-operate with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Tourism and Trade and other relevant Ministries of the Government of Timor-Leste, in order to achieve these goals.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Timor-Leste a tiny nation in the world can lend its commitment to climate change aspects by assisting the people in changing the way the country people cook and heat water. Currently they use wood by cutting trees and thus weakening the roots systems of the mountain sides which results in landslides in the raining season and further destroying houses in the pathway of the landslides. We all know that burning of wood creates smokes and thus toxins are released from the wood in the process of creating a heat suitable for cooking. Cooking with natural gas can dramatically improve the health of many women and children as they tend to spend much time in the kitchen preparing meals.</p>

And absolutely a huge reduction in toxins being immitted in the atmosphere therefore assisting greatly with environmental issues and climate change aspects.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Another aspect of Fundación’s desire to bring natural gas to the people outside of environmental issues and clean air is the preservation of the trees and protection of people’s property from landslides as well as the economics of using natural piped gas. Cooking with Natural Gas is more cost effective than cooking with wood in Timor-Leste although up until now the country people can purchase wood bundles from as low as us $0.50. This small out of pocket money has a huge aspect on their budget but when you multiply this small amount to the capacity of a 9kg LP Gas cylinder we discover the actual cost of cooking with wood is much greater than cooking with LP Gas. Natural Gas is much economical than LP Gas. As life is not free, the Fundação shall supply Prepaid meters with credit (pulsa) payments as low as us$0.50 thus assisting the country people convert from fire wood to using Natural Gas. The Fundação thus seeks Donor funding for the   purchase and installation of the Natural Gas Network, storage facilities, pipes, meters, valves and the very first natural gas stove to each household. Thus, the installations charges and all associated materials costs do not need to be passed onto the poorest people of the tiny nation. We all respect that a Foundation is a not-for-profit organization and any residue of funds always returns to the people through the objectives of the Fundação.</p>

                                We believe it is a Timorese culture for women to collect and carry the wood to their houses. The weights are between 15 to 30 kilos that they must carry on their head at any one time.

Would you like your daughters to carry these heavy weights on their heads from the fields to the house just so they can cook?

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, DeepGulf, C-Gas and Fundação Gino Favaro NGO of Timor-Leste have teamed together to distribute a portion of the landed gas to municipalities, commercial and industrial concerns to aid in economic and industrial development of Timor-Leste and also for residential, cooking and water heating usage. They want to do this firstly in the Districts, so that it will reduce deforestation and positively preserve the environment and improve the health of the people by not having wood smoke in their kitchens.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Through this Natural Gas, Transportation, Storage, and Supply Network, the Fundação Gino Favaro intends to draw on this supply network to install & operate Natural Gas connections to each household in each the municipality. Converting the Electricity Power Supply locations within Timor-Leste to Natural Gas has many benefits, basically, to reduce pollution from using diesel fuels. Natural Gas is more economical to acquire than diesel, Natural Gas offers better maintenance costs to the Generator Engines than Diesel, and so on.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Fundação Gino Favaro is an excellent partner to have since its revenue base is to assist and support the vulnerable Timorese in the community with other aims such as to assist educational activities in support of developing students skills and in promoting Timor-Leste to the world.</p>

The Fundação also desires to provide social support to the most vulnerable people in the Timorese society is to bring fresh water to each household outside of the Capital Dili. We appreciate that there are very few houses outside of the Capital Dili that have piped network of fresh water to each house. The family members need to walk 45 minutes or more from their house to collect water in 1L to 5L plastic bottles then walk the same time back to the house again. The Fundação desires to seek permission from the Timor-Leste Government to install & operate fresh water delivery by pipe to each household that does not already have piped water.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The Fundação will be seeking donor funding for the complete installation and associated materials costs including storage facilities, pumps, pipes and prepaid meters. For those of us that have fresh water in our house, we are very fortunate we don’t have to carry heavy loads of water on our heads and in our hands for such long periods of time every day. How nice would it be for the country people of Timor-Leste the poorest people of Timor-Leste to enjoy such a luxury of enjoying a hot shower at home with fresh water heated by natural gas. Can you imagine the smiles and happiness of these people and the excitement of the family members that currently walks every day to collect the water for cooking and showering? How much could their life be changed by these piped natural gas and fresh water to their houses. Just a couple of thoughts tells it all.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The objectives of Fundação Gino Favaro we have talked about so far seem very essential to the improvement of the quality of life to all those people that will receive a change in life due to the installation of natural gas and fresh water to each house and further appreciate that students will also enjoy the benefits of the specialized practical training facilities that will be on offer and I believe that the students that pass the written tests and practical exams of these programs are headed for a great future, possibly a great chance of enjoying long term employment with the Fundação’s many new hotels or tourism locations  or even working with the natural gas and fresh water network systems, not to mention all of the other projects we have not discussed as yet. We can see from these desires of the Fundação the future students could have a quality job in the industry and feel confident and secure in themselves that they are professional in their chosen field. And that they thoroughly understand their new responsibilities and commitments and are able to carry out their new job with expertise.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The Fundação visualizes how much material benefit and economic benefits of each construction site of a new hotel and each construction site of a new developing tourism location will bring to each and every town or village of the country side with the added benefit of natural gas and fresh water to each house. Then of course those permanent jobs that will be created at each location. The permanent jobs shall bring lasting economic benefits to the many families in each location. The operation of each hotel shall itself bring economic benefits to the local farmers as the hotels will require fresh produce of all descriptions every day. The shopping centers attached to each hotel, I presume, will be specially designed assisting the locals to be able to display and sell their local artifacts and home sewing and indigenous crafts and souvenirs to the shoppers. This will further provide an opportunity for the Ladies of the community to be creative and thus enjoy the economic benefits of these locations.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the classrooms attached to each Practical Training Facility can be used for the upskilling of older members of the communities. Upskilling the older members of the communities allows them to have some time out of the house and allows them to further develop skills of their interests that they may not have been able to do so at any other time of their life. Let’s teach the older members of the communities to use the Internet what abuzz that would be for them since some of them don’t even have a phone. They may not know what the other side of the world looks like, but these classrooms at each Training Facility at each hotel could have a huge positive impact for each community as it offers an opportunity that is not currently available. Lastly, the Fundação understands that the development of each project will be undertaken by as many locals as possible particularly those from the country towns and villages, this will bring economic relief to those smaller towns and villages that would not normally be exposed to such opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="fst-italic">(Here ends Mr. Favaro’s words.)</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">These three objectives are just the starting plans of the foundation. But I believe many different successful things could still appear in the near future if enough number of people could hear and listen to the hopes of the Fundação Gino Favaro to the people of Timor-Leste. If anyone is reading this now, now is the time to lend your hands to the people of Timor-Leste. Help them to build a better future for their small Nation. Help them to show what they are capable of.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">In the next series of this article, we will discuss thoroughly the aims of the Foundation, specifically the Foundation’s plan of the Nation’s religious sites and a brief history of the founders. But for now, I will leave you with a poetry by Mr. Gino Favaro to the Nation of Timor-Leste entitled, “Timor-Leste.”</p>
