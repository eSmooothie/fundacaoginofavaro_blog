                  </div>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">To fortify the important of this Relationship there was a desire for the MOU process to be carried out as per  Traditional methods. Mr Gino Favaro was thank full that Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned the process that was needed to be undertaken as Mr Gino Favaro is of foreign origin although now a Timor-Leste Citizen the respect of Local Culture and Traditional Activities is a very important part of life in Timor-Leste.  Mr Gino Favaro was delighted to understand and accept the Traditional and Cultural Process. The Singing of this MOU was carried out with Cultural Significance and the Highest of Respect attached to this activity  as it was accepted as an opportunity to Support and Promote and Aid in the Economic Development of  the Town of Soibada a very much needed push to help the young people of the area engage in a carrier path and to bring economic prosperity to Soibada.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">The discussions leading to the signing of the MOU took place in several location, the first location was the premises of Mr. Gino Favaro’s  residence at the very Famous Hotel Dili, in Dili  the Capital of Timor-Leste owned by Mr. Gino Favaro and family for the last 50 years.  Since Feb 1971.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">At the Hotel Dili, Mr Gino Fávaro and  Mr. Joanico da Costa, the Principal of Escola Tecnica Vocasional Prezidente Nicolau Lobato, Soibada, discussed the overall intentions of the relationship and how the students of the Escola Tecnica Vocasional Prezidente Nicolau Lobato, Soibada, whom were undertaking the completion of the first 3 year course of Hospitality & Tourism at this college, were to benefit from this MOU relationship.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Some Subsequent meeting took place at the Technical School so Mr Gino Favaro could appreciate the actual underdeveloped state, the school was actually in at that moment. Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned that it would be an excellent idea for the students to study what Tourism & Religious Tourism Potential, was actually in their own “back yard, so to say” but more like within the Municipality’s Administrative Post of Soibada location.</p>
                  <div class="d-flex  align-items-center">

                    <p class="mb-0 " style="text-align:justify;padding: 0px 30px 0px 0px;">Most of Timor-Leste is in an undeveloped state and the economics of the families is very limited so Mr Gino Favaro offered 2 compact cameras to selected students to document the Historical Event.
                        Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned that he would need to  seek permission from the Ministry of Education to develop a change in the  student’s major project for the third year to that of  studying and researching the potential of Tourism and Religious Tourism aspect in the Municipality’s Administrative Post of Soibada location.
                      </p>

                      <p class="text-center m-0 text-secondary" style="font-size: 15px;"><small>Students outside during the signing of MOU</small></p>

                  </div>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Several members of the community were invited to witness this Historical Event from parents of the students and veterans of the community to  Elders in the community. As a process of student involvement the Principal recommended that the MCs Master of Ceremonies should be students from the school in the 3rd year, one female and one male, Mr Gino Favaro commented on what an excellent job the 2 x MCs student did.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">The catering for the event was done by the rest of the students as a school practical cooking exercise, The local cuisine displayed for all to enjoy was produce from the gardens of the school students parent’s in the area. There was some very interesting and  appetizing flavours.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">This Memorandum of Understanding is to engage in and build a base of cooperation and activities in the process of developing with Mr Gino Favaro, several Timor-Leste Tourism and Religious Tourism Books, these books are to include Modern Tourism & Religious Tourism, Historical & Cultural Tourism, Nature Tourism, & Animism Tourism. Agricultural Tourism, Traditional Cuisine Activities,  Traditional Food Markets, Basket Weaving Activities,  & Natural Local Souvenirs, Tasting TUA SABU the Naturally Brewed local Alcoholic Beverage and other Potential Sites & Activities In Soibada and then later  rest of Timor-Leste.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">The MOU was formed to give Timor-Leste, Soibada Hospitality & Tourism 3rd year students the opportunity to research and study their own “back-yard” and to gather information and data that would be suitable to use in print and other media forms in the development of these Books or other promotional material covering these Hospitality and Tourism activities.</p>
                  <h5>The Collection of Data by the Students</h5>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally this data collected by the students would be used to identify any Tourism & Religious Tourism, Nature Tourism and other related Tourism opportunities that could be developed for Pilgrims purposes and promotion purposes and the possibility of commercial opportunities in the area of Soibada.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Any commercial possibilities will have a direct effect to the economic development of Soibada through employment opportunities and related souvenir and artifacts and fruit and vegetables and other local produce sales. The Fundação Directors have been told that Soibada’s.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Most of The Data collected by the students was not previous available in the market place and as such has become valuable data that could be employed in assessing the potential of Soibada as a Prime Tourism Location of Timor-Leste.   This Data has certainly opened up the eyes of the Board Of Directors of the Fundação  Gino Favaro.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">There will be particular attention towards the Historical and Current information of Religious Sites or other Location of interest, any persons of interest, any current Hospitality and Tourism activities and naturally Hospitality and Tourism Opportunities.
                    The First set of 3rd Year Students was progressing through their last year of  their Hospitality and Tourism Diploma Course. The Major project for these 3rd year students 2nd half of the semester in 2019 was changed with the approval of the Minister of Education we understand. This change of curriculum was based on two important events, one was the signing of the MOU with Mr Gino Favaro and the other was the School wanted an opportunity to engage in a new approach of a new future industry development of Timor-Leste “Religious Tourism.” Religious Tourism, the catalyst opportunity of signing the MOU with Mr Gino Favaro was that this Technical School then would be the first school to head in a new industry direction. The MOU was developed as an open MOU Document  in as much as each year the School would give the students a new location to study, Tourism, Religious Tourism, Traditional Activities, Historical Religious Activities, and other Tourism Potential aspects and opportunities  in and around their own Municipality’s Administrative Post of Soibada location and then on to the rest of the country.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">The First Class of  3rd year students were offered several choices of studies for their end of  year  graduation course,  this major final year project was to be carried out by groups of students to enable the learning process to be shared amongst each member of the group.
