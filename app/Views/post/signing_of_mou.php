              <p style="text-align:justify;">To fortify the important of this Relationship there was a desire for the MOU process to be carried out as per  Traditional methods. Mr Gino Favaro was thank full that Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned the process that was needed to be undertaken as Mr Gino Favaro is of foreign origin although now a Timor-Leste Citizen the respect of Local Culture and Traditional Activities is a very important part of life in Timor-Leste.  Mr Gino Favaro was delighted to understand and accept the Traditional and Cultural Process. The Singing of this MOU was carried out with Cultural Significance and the Highest of Respect attached to this activity  as it was accepted as an opportunity to Support and Promote and Aid in the Economic Development of  the Town of Soibada a very much needed push to help the young people of the area engage in a carrier path and to bring economic prosperity to Soibada.</p>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The discussions leading to the signing of the MOU took place in several location, the first location was the premises of Mr. Gino Favaro’s  residence at the very Famous Hotel Dili, in Dili  the Capital of Timor-Leste owned by Mr. Gino Favaro and family for the last 50 years.  Since Feb 1971.</p>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">At the Hotel Dili, Mr Gino Fávaro and  Mr. Joanico da Costa, the Principal of Escola Tecnica Vocasional Prezidente Nicolau Lobato, Soibada, discussed the overall intentions of the relationship and how the students of the Escola Tecnica Vocasional Prezidente Nicolau Lobato, Soibada, whom were undertaking the completion of the first 3 year course of Hospitality & Tourism at this college, were to benefit from this MOU relationship.</p>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">Some Subsequent meeting took place at the Technical School so Mr Gino Favaro could appreciate the actual underdeveloped state, the school was actually in at that moment. Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned that it would be an excellent idea for the students to study what Tourism & Religious Tourism Potential, was actually in their own “back yard, so to say” but more like within the Municipality’s Administrative Post of Soibada location.</p>
              <div class="d-flex  align-items-center">

                <p class="mb-0 " style="text-align:justify;padding: 0px 30px 0px 0px;">Most of Timor-Leste is in an undeveloped state and the economics of the families is very limited so Mr Gino Favaro offered 2 compact cameras to selected students to document the Historical Event.
                    Mr. Joanico da Costa mentioned that he would need to  seek permission from the Ministry of Education to develop a change in the  student’s major project for the third year to that of  studying and researching the potential of Tourism and Religious Tourism aspect in the Municipality’s Administrative Post of Soibada location.
