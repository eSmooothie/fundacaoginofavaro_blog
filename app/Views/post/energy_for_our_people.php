                <h4 class="text-center fw-normal mt-4">The Plan to Provide Abundant <br>Inexpensive Electrical and Hydrocarbon (oil) <br>Energy to the People of Timor-Leste</h4>
                <h4 class="text-center fw-normal mt-4">Engineered and Supported by Deep Gulf and C-Gas and Fundação Gino Fávaro NGO of Timor-Leste</h4>
                <hr>
                <h5 class="section-heading">Timor-Leste- Challenges and Oppotunities</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the steepest challenges confronting island economies like Timor-Leste, is the unavailability of inexpensive energy – primarily electrical and hydrocarbon (oil). The reasons are multiple, ranging from environmental concerns to the absence of industrial base load, but they are mostly related to excessive distance from the oil refinery, which renders liquid fuels such as diesel oil expensive when delivered, even in times of very low crude oil prices.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">he cheaper alternative to liquid fuels is natural gas, provided it can be procured within a short distance and at low cost. The technical, economic, and environmental advantages of natural gas are many: it does not require refining, it is clean, it can substitute very easily and flexibly for liquid fuels in engine and turbine generators, and it is relatively inexpensive to produce, particularly from so-called stranded fields with no commercial outlet other than a nearby market. However, until the DeepGulf C-GAS technologies were developed, the main disadvantage of natural gas was that a pipeline was required for transportation, which precluded multiple destinations from multiple sources, and was not technically feasible around oceanic islands because of excessive water depths and difficult sea bottom topographies.</p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">I. DEEP GULF’S TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">To confront and overcome this stubborn obstacle, DeepGulf developed the C-GAS natural gas marine transportation technologies and solutions, which revolve around a number of unique technical choices and innovations:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Optimized carrier design with C-GAS specific machinery and navigational features;</li>
                  <li>Exclusive containment and hold design with C-GAS specific safety technologies;</li>
                  <li>Exclusive natural gas handling system, incorporating proprietary safe and efficient transfer system;</li>
                  <li>Overall enhanced safety design</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">II. BUSINESS MODEL</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to offering these exclusive technologies which provide DeepGulf and C-Gas (herein afterward referred to as DeepGulf) with a unique set of industrial and technical tools and solutions, DeepGulf is open to various business models that to accommodate the needs and requisites of its client and puts it in position to offer products and services that are tightly isolated from the turbulences of volatile international energy markets. The main business model characteristics are:</p>

                  <li>DeepGulf can operate or source natural gas deposits that are dedicated to its clients, in a vertically integrated fashion</li>
                  <li>DeepGulf delivers energy at a fixed price over 15 to 30 year long term firm contracts</li>
                  <li>DeepGulf and C-Gas can offer flexibility in ownership of equipment and operations and licensing of proprietary technologies that meet client needs</li>
                  <li>DeepGulf and G-Gas can offer innovative financing strategies to fund development and buildout of equipment and infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">More comprehensively, the DeepGulf specific benefits are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>DeepGulf designs integrated natural gas energy systems</li>

                  <li>DeepGulf is not affected by the volatility of energy markets</li>
                </ol>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">III. TIMOR-LESTE’S ENERGY FOR OUR PEOPLE</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Timor-Leste is an independent half-island country located in the north of the Timor Sea, approximately 250 miles north of Australia. Its population is about 1.2 million. Two brand-new power plants were commissioned in 2012 and 2013, each with an installed power of 125 MW, capable of burning either diesel oil or natural gas. Only diesel oil has been used so far, at a cost influenced as much by fuel market prices in Singapore as by the requirement to transport the diesel oil frequently over a distance of 2,000 miles and more, in rather small tankers because of navigational and regulatory constraints in these waters, which means that diesel oil delivered to the power plants cannot be cheap even when diesel oil at the refinery is priced at the lowest levels. On the other hand, there exist in the Timor Sea a number of gas fields within a distance of a few hundred miles, some with associated oil, large enough to power Timor-Leste and neighboring islands for decades to come, but not large enough to warrant the very high capital and operating costs incurred in the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for exports to Japan and Korea.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">DeepGulf has been present in Timor-Leste since 2007 and has conducted important surveys for the Government, bathymetric, oceanographic, geotechnical, geophysical, and oceanographic. DeepGulf’s proprietary technology enables it to deliver quantities of natural gas equivalent to twice the energy currently produced with diesel oil and still be at a lower cost to the Government. DeepGulf plans, which are dynamic and can be modified to meet changes in client needs and objectives, consists of the delivery at virtually fixed price of natural gas sufficient to produce up to 2 million kWh per day from fields located in the Timor Sea. The project requires the construction of a 400 foot long carrier (120 meters), capable of transporting 15 million cubic feet of natural gas. Infrastructure will include one loading and one offloading swiveled buoy, one 6 mile 8 inch loading pipeline and one 2 mile 8 inch offloading pipeline, 3 days’ worth of gas storage onshore, and all ancillary equipment. The carrier will be dynamically positioned which will enhance safety. The construction budget at the time of this writing is $200 million.
                </p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">IV. OUTCOMES AND INNITIATIVES</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The primary outcome with be less expensive source fuel for electrical generation which means dramatically less expensive electrical energy to all users in Timor-Leste. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Further the landed gas can be made available for other, yet equally important uses.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">DeepGulf, C-Gas and Fundação Gino Favaro NGO of Timor-Leste have teamed together to distribute a portion of the landed gas to municipalities, commercial and industrial concerns to aid in economic and industrial development of Timor-Leste and also for residential, cooking and water heating usage, firstly in the Districts, that will seriously reduce deforestation and positively preserve the environment and improve the health of the people by not having wood smoke in the kitchens an essential medical improvement for our People.</p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">V. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">DeepGulf can deliver natural gas from an array of eleven potential gas fields. The gas can be sourced progressively from several districts of the Timor Sea: ConocoPhillips’ Bayu Undan field and Sunrise in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA); PTTEP’s Montara field in the Ashmore and Cartier area; the unleased Chuditch field in the JPDA; and finally the PTTEP Oliver field also in the Ashmore and Cartier area. PTTEP is the national petroleum company of Thailand. While the latter two fields will be developed at a later stage, the former two are currently in operation, Bayu Undan since 2004 and Montara since 2013, and will require only moderate capital expenditure before deliveries can start.</p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">VI. FACILITY MANUFACTURING</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">DeepGulf has developed relationships with a number of select South Korean manufacturers and shipbuilders. Carriers and equipment will be built and assembled in high quality South Korean shipyards.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The containment system will be manufactured and assembled by NK, a world leader in the production of the large high pressure vessels used for storing a variety of natural and industrial gasses. Engineering for the pressure vessels that will take place in DeepGulf’s carriers was done jointly over a three year period, and extensive full scale testing was conducted in 2013, which demonstrated feasibility of the project. The professional and reliable manufacturing of the pressure vessels is critical to our project.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The carriers, which will benefit from the innovative DeepGulf design, will be built onshore as modules, in several yards, each with a particular specialty, and will be assembled near the NK facility and the Port of Pusan. Machinery and thrusters will be built in the U.S., and the dynamically positioning system in Norway. Crews will be trained in Cebu, in the Philippines, in DeepGulf’s Norwegian managed training center.</p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">VII. DEEP GULS’S TECHNOLOGIES</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">DeepGulf offers many novel technologies, collectively called the C-GAS technologies. These technologies apply to: A. the hull and machinery of the natural gas carries; B. the natural gas containment and handling; and C. the safety of personnel.</p>
                <h4 class="section-heading mt-5">A. C-GAS technologies features and benefits: hull and machinery</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span class="fw-bold">Hull construction</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The hull of our marine carriers is hydrodynamically optimized, with no through-hull fittings and no rudder. Underwater hull growth is removed twice a year by divers. Thrusters are removable from under the hull for easy and frequent maintenance and replacement in order to dramatically reduce dry docking requirements</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Competing designs use classic hull construction, with rudder and hull fittings. Carriers require dry docking at least annually or once every two years, but will not be able to enter dry dock because depressurization other than to atmosphere is not possible.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span class="fw-bold">Ship propulsion and positioning</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS uses Dynamic Positioning to enhance safety of repetitive tasks and avoid contact and chafing with piers or buoys. Operation of carriers is highly automated.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Competing systems use regular mooring. Operations are manual. Highly repetitive tasks lead to heightened risk of major accident. Dock proximity increases risk of accidental collision and ignition.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span class="fw-bold">Inerting of cargo holds</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS developed a 100% inert gas conditioning system to prevent any intrusion of oxygen in the containment areas, together with a novel pressure compensation system</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Exclusive inerting system uses carrier generated nitrogen. 100% of hold volume is inerted and all oxygen is removed from holds.</li>
                  <li>Exclusive hold compartment design and fire extinguishing system prevents accidental combustion of accidental gas release, even in case of unplanned air ingress.</li>
                  <li>Venting of inert gas and accidental gas release is done through exclusive multi-hold venting mechanism, 18 meters (60 ft) above deck.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Competing systems have storage tanks installed above deck, to exploit a loophole in classification societies (i.e. DNV, ABS), rules. Thus, inerting is not possible. This technical choice is extremely unsafe and is highly unlikely to be permitted by authorities.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span class="fw-bold">Engines</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS uses gas turbines exclusively. No under deck engine room, all engines are positioned in structures above deck for easy maintenance and replacement.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Others use diesel engines or dual fuel engines in engine room, which poses severe safety risks and logistical concerns.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span class="fw-bold">Energy fuel</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS uses cargo natural gas as exclusive fuel during operations. Diesel fuel can be used without modification when repositioning light ship.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Carriers must burn expensive diesel fuel, additionally creating severe logistical problems.</p>
                <h4 class="section-heading mt-5">B. C-GAS technologies features and benefits: natural gas containment and handling</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span class="fw-bold">Gas composition</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS carriers can transport many combinations of wet and sour gas in different physical phases, thanks to its unique containment design.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Competing designs require absolutely dry and sweet natural gas, which limits scope severely.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span class="fw-bold">Natural Gas Handling and Transfer</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS developed an exclusive natural gas transfer system that offers the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Exclusive swiveled buoy is used both for gas loading and offloading: gas carriers never enter port, mostly for safety reasons.</li>
                  <li>Carriers use proprietary loading/offloading quick connect/disconnect system.</li>
                  <li>Natural gas is transferred from production platform to uploading buoy and from offloading buoy to power plant through underwater pipeline.</li>
                  <li>Onboard, there is a single point of handling transfer connections, external to ship’s hull.</li>
                  <li>C-GAS uses a proprietary transfer system to cancel residual pressure for complete transfer, thus allowing quick and total depressurization of gas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Others plan to load from and offload to piers in constrained busy channels. Their CNG carriers will not be able to obtain warrants and circumvent current regulations that prohibit gas carrier traffic in populated environments. For reference, current LNG carriers operate in specially designed facilities, far from general cargo ports, and do not transit through busy waterways, although LNG is inherently less hazardous than CNG. Competitors propose multiple points of handling, located amidships. More importantly, competing designs use expensive and energy intensive turbo-compressors. Only about 75% of their cargo can be transferred.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span class="fw-bold">Gas containment</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS’ gas containment system offers several advantages compared to competing techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Containment units are installed vertically deep in hold, which allows multiple phases in containment and easy servicing and maintenance.</li>
                  <li>Passive pressure cut-off system prevents natural gas discharge in case of collision.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Others have containment units installed horizontally on deck or in holds. Servicing and maintenance are not possible. In case of a collision all affected units will discharge their high pressure natural gas load to the atmosphere, creating a hazardous situation.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span class="fw-bold">Containment system maintenance</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Maintenance of C-GAS carriers and containment units is done on a cycle basis, units being regularly transferred to shore for inspection and maintenance.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">With other designs, total depressurization is impossible and maintenance of cargo containment system is therefore not offered.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span class="fw-bold">Gas pressure</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Thanks to its sophisticated handling system, C-GAS uses a pressure of 150 bars (2,100 psi) only, with better compressibility factor and less hazard that competition’s 250 bars (3,600 psi) pressure and higher, in a much safer environment.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">6. <span class="fw-bold">Thermal performance</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS’ exclusive design comprehensively prevents the unavoidable thermal shocks of competing systems.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">In competing designs temperature drops of 60 to 80 °C (140 to 180 °F) are unavoidable, thus affecting both material fatigue and safety, and creating unavoidable ice blockages, some irreversible.</p>
                <h4 class="section-heading mt-5">C. C-GAS technologies features and benefits: personnel safety</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span class="fw-bold">Accommodation aftercastle</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Front of aftercastle is blind and reinforced to prevent crew exposure in case of accident. All accommodations face aft, except the bridge, which is accessible separately.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Others use regular accommodation design with no protection of personnel.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span class="fw-bold">Deck work</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS design does not require work on deck, and even prohibits it. Forecastle operations are either automated, or carried out by special shore crew from outside of carrier.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Others need personnel to walk freely to and fro, which contravenes basic safety rules.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span class="fw-bold">Crew management</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Carrier has a dual skippers and mates on board. Ship and on/off-shore crews alternate functions before or after each shore leave. Rotations are short, only a few weeks, to enhance performance and safety.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span class="fw-bold">Training</span></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">C-GAS is setting up an exclusive and proprietary marine training academy located in Cebu, the Philippines, with Norwegian management.</p>
                <h5 class="section-heading mt-5">VIII. TARIFFS</h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Tariffs are based on volume of deliveries and final distance to the fields.  Client may upgrade their delivery plan to higher delivery rates at any time with a two year notice and corresponding modification to delivery contract. Upgraded delivery rates within a plan need to be confirmed with a two year notice. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Sample tariffs can be provided upon request and generally are per year. Payments are made monthly.</p>
